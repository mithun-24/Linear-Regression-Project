# Linear Regression Project

## Overview
This project implements a Linear Regression model to predict total sales based on advertising expenditure data. The workflow follows a standard data science pipeline, including data loading, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature preparation, model training, and performance evaluation.

## Objective
Develop a predictive model that estimates sales using advertising budget features and evaluate its performance using appropriate regression metrics.

## Dataset
The dataset contains advertising spend across multiple channels and the corresponding sales figures.

**Typical features:**
- TV advertising budget  
- Radio advertising budget  
- Newspaper advertising budget  
- Sales (target variable)

## Workflow
1. Data Loading and Inspection  
2. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing  
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
4. Feature Selection  
5. Train-Test Split  
6. Model Training using Linear Regression  
7. Model Evaluation and Interpretation  

## Technologies Used
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn  
- Jupyter Notebook  

## Model Evaluation
The model performance is evaluated using regression metrics such as:

- R² Score  
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)  
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)  
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
